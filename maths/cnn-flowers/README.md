# Construction of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

### Abstract
This project explores the mathematical architecture and implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Beyond simply implementing a model, this paper derives the underlying calculus of the learning process, specifically applying these concepts to a multi-class image classification task (Flower Recognition).

### Mathematical Focus
* **Convolution Operations:** Analysis of feature extraction using normalized and Gaussian filters.
* **Optimization Algorithms:** Derivation of **Gradient Descent** and the integration of **Momentum** to prevent local minima stagnation.
* **Backpropagation:** Application of the **Chain Rule** in multivariable calculus to compute gradients for weight updates ($\frac{\partial J}{\partial w}$).

### Implementation Results
* **Architecture:** Custom CNN with convolutional, max-pooling, and fully connected layers.
* **Performance:** Achieved **95% accuracy** on the test dataset with a loss minimized to <0.1.
* **Stack:** Python, Mathematical derivation in $\LaTeX$.
