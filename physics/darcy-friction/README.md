# Analysis of the Darcy Friction Factor

### Abstract
This study investigates the fluid dynamics of laminar flow, specifically the relationship between the Darcy friction factor ($f$) and the Reynolds number ($Re$) in smooth pipe environments. The research verifies the theoretical predictions of the Hagen-Poiseuille equation through experimental analysis.

### Methodology
* **Experimental Setup:** Constructed a variable flow-rate rig using a manometer setup to measure pressure differential ($\Delta P$) across a known pipe length.
* **Data Analysis:** Linearization of the power law relationship $f = \frac{64}{Re}$ using logarithmic transformation ($ln(f)$ vs ln(Re)).

### Key Findings
* The experimental data confirmed the inverse proportionality between friction and the Reynolds number.
* **Gradient Analysis:** The experimental gradient was calculated at **-0.9763**, which aligns with the theoretical gradient of **-1** within a tight margin of error.
